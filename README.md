I would like to create an educational cooking game which will utilize HTML canvas to teach users how to make a basic and authentic stir fry.  My game will take a user through the process of selecting and preparing ingredients, then it will allow the user to sequentially add ingredients to the wok in order to stir fry them.  Upon completion, the user will be given a proper, written recipe that would allow them to replicate their creation in real life.

Functionality & MVPs

In 'Stir Fry Anything', users will be able to:
  select ingredients from multiple categories and place onto a tray which acts as inventory
  travel from level-to-level while inventory persists
  modify the state of individual ingredients through user input
  beat the game by following instructions to assemble their dish
  be rewarded with a true recipe

In addition, this project will include:
  a formal README
  dynamic instructions which change as user progresses
